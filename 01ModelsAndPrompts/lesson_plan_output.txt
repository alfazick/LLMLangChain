Lesson Title: Mastering For Loops in C++

Lesson Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes 

Objective:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to understand and use for loops in C++ to iterate through data structures and perform repetitive tasks.

Materials:
- Computer with C++ compiler
- Presentation slides on for loops
- Code examples 
- Whiteboard and markers

Introduction (5 minutes):
- Greet the students and introduce the topic of for loops
- Explain the importance of for loops in programming
- Share the learning objectives for the lesson

Explanation (20 minutes):
- Define for loops and explain their purpose
- Discuss the syntax of for loops in C++
- Show examples of for loops in action
- Explain the three components of a for loop: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement
- Discuss the different types of for loops (counting, nested, and infinite)
- Demonstrate how to use for loops to iterate through arrays and perform repetitive tasks

Guided Practice (25 minutes):
- Provide students with a coding challenge to implement a for loop in C++
- Guide them through the process and provide assistance as needed
- Encourage students to ask questions and provide feedback

Independent Practice (20 minutes):
- Assign
