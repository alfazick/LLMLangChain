Structure of the ==> Router Chain <==

The router chain consists of three key components:

Router chain: This chain decides the next chain to be called.

Destination chain: These chains represent the options available for the 
router chain to redirect the input to.

Default chain: When the router chain canâ€™t decide which chain to use, 
it redirects to the default chain that provides a default output.
