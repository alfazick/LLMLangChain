Observation: CPU scheduling is a process carried out by the operating system to manage the execution of processes on the CPU. It involves selecting processes from the ready queue and allocating the CPU to them based on certain criteria, such as priority, time-sharing, or other scheduling algorithms. The goal of CPU scheduling is to optimize the utilization of the CPU and improve system performance by efficiently managing the execution of processes.

{

}
```
Observation: The implementation of CPU scheduling can involve various algorithms such as First In, First Out (FIFO) scheduling or First Come, First Served (FCFS) scheduling. Additionally, schedulers can incorporate I/O by treating each CPU burst as a job, ensuring that interactive processes are run frequently and allowing CPU-intensive jobs to run while interactive jobs are performing I/O.
