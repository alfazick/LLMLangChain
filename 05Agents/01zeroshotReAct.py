Zero-shot ReAct
The Zero-shot ReAct agent operates on a unique framework known as "reasoning and action" (ReAct). 
It is particularly useful in scenarios where no prior examples or training on a specific task is available 
(hence "zero-shot"). 
This agent excels in situations that require on-the-spot reasoning and decision-making based on the 
tools and information at its disposal.

Reasoning: This component of the agent is responsible for understanding the context, 
formulating plans, and making informed decisions based on the available data. 
It continuously updates its strategies as new information becomes available or as situations evolve.

Action: Once a plan or decision is made, the action component takes over. 
This part is responsible for executing the decided actions, which might include interacting with APIs, 
querying databases, or even engaging in dialogue with humans to gather or deliver information."""
